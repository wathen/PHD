 \chapter{Linear Solver}

In many applications one of the main problems is to find the solution of a linear system. This system may arise form an optimisation or, like here, a discretised PDE. In this chapter we will go through the two methods which this is done.

\section{Direct Methods}

Suppose you are given a linear system of the form
$$Ax = b$$
where $A$ is a real $n\times n$ non-singular matrix and right hand side vector $b \in \mathcal{R}^n$, where the aim is to solve for the vector $x \in \mathcal{R}^n$. All direct methods are based on Gaussian elimination.
